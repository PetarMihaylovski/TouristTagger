# Tourist Attraction Tagger
This project was the final product for Android Development course in
Saxion University of Applied Science First year, quartile 3.

## Description:
The application I made is called “Tourist Attraction Tagger”.
The user chooses from a city and “tags” from the tourist attractions in that city.
After the user has chosen the places the user has been, he/she can see where his/her “friends” have been.
Also, if the user can edit the places, he/she has been.
The application has an administrator login, which allows you to add new cities and new tourist attractions,
remove already existing cities and existing tourist attractions and also edit the same information. 

## What I learned:
* Display data in ListView, and creating a custom adapter,
so I can arrange the data in the ListView the way I want.
* Work with more data, that I previously have worked with.
* Design activities code-wise and UI-wise
* Separation of concerns.
